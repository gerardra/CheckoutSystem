# CheckoutSystem
ComputerPhil is starting a computer store. You have been engaged to build the checkout system. We will start with the following products in our catalogue

SKU	Name	Price
ipd	Super iPad	$549.99
mbp	MacBook Pro	$1399.99
atv	Apple TV	$109.50
vga	VGA adapter	$30.00
As we're launching our new computer store, we would like to have a few opening day specials.

Following are the deals we have for the opening day
1) 3 for 2 deal on Apple TVs. For example, if you buy 3 Apple TVs, you will pay the price of 2 only
2) The brand new Super iPad will have a bulk discounted applied, where the price will drop to $499.99 each, 
3) More than 4 we will bundle in a free VGA adapter free of charge with every MacBook Pro sold

As our Sales manager is quite indecisive, we want the pricing rules to be as flexible as possible as they can change in the future with little notice.
